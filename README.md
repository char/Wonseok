# Wonseok

Wonseok (원석; Stone, Ore) is a Korean Input Method Editor (IME) for Minecraft GuiTextFields.

Since LWJGL 2 disables IMEs on non-Windows systems, I wrote this mod to input Korean.

## Usage

Currently, the only layout supported is dubeolsik (2벌식).
The system is extensible, however, so 3벌 support should be fairly easy to implement.

Also planned is a 'Romaja' input, which 'hangeulizes' input into Korean, for instance, 'annyeong' would become '안녕'.
